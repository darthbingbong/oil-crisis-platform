News ingestion -- NewsAPI.org's /v2/everything endpoint.

(Originally built against Alpha Vantage's NEWS_SENTIMENT per the project
brief's primary recommendation -- discovered via a real, live call that
NEWS_SENTIMENT is premium-only now, even with no query params at all: the
response is `{"Information": "...premium endpoint..."}`. Not a bug in this
code; verified directly against the raw API. Switched to NewsAPI.org, the
brief's own first-listed fallback, which has a genuinely free "Developer"
tier -- no card required, documented at newsapi.org/pricing. This file is
the only one that touches a provider's specific response shape, so a
future swap back to Alpha Vantage (if upgraded) or on to GNews is a
contained change here, not a rewrite of the pipeline.)

Degrades gracefully by design: with no NEWSAPI_API_KEY set,
fetch_live_articles() returns an empty list and logs that it's running in
fixture-only mode, rather than crashing or fabricating data.

NewsAPI has no per-article topic/relevance score the way Alpha Vantage
did -- instead we push a targeted OR-query of our highest-signal terms
server-side (so NewsAPI itself does the first cut), and the existing
keyword filter (relevance.py) still runs as a second, independent layer
afterward.
