EV / lithium conversion module.

Deterministic unit conversion, not a trained model -- no ML here on
purpose. Answers: "if a crisis knocks out X barrels/day of crude, how
does that translate into gasoline displaced, gasoline-vehicle-years of
fuel, and how much lithium (as LCE, lithium carbonate equivalent) would
be needed to build enough EV batteries to replace that many vehicles?"

All conversion factors are the ones specified in the project brief.
They are averages / rules of thumb, not certified constants -- flagged
inline where a number is an assumption rather than a physical fact.
